# Housinganywhere

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2. 
This application displays profile details for the characters fetched using the [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
This is done as part of the front end assessment for Housing Anywhere.
